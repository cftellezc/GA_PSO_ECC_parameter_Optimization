# GA_PSO_ECC_parameter_Optimization
This code compares Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in optimizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) parameters, including coefficients, prime number, and more. Analyzing performances under a shared fitness function, it tests the optimized parameters in a simulated e-commerce setting.
